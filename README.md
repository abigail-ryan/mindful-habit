### User Stories
#### Primary Goal

Mindful Habit is a site for women looking to learn how to practice mindfulness. The website needed to give users an insight into what Mindful Habit is about and a brief introduction of Mindful Habits 4 teaching techniques and their respective classes available.

#### Visitor Goals

Mindful Habits classes are for women of all ages, and it was a requirement that the website be a welcoming and calming space, that has a fresh and clutter free design. The Home page needs to showcase the classes available to users and encourage them to join. The gallery section of the site needs to show that all ages are welcome and give new site visitors a glimpse of what Mindful Habit classes look like. The site needs to be easy to navigate for all users seeking information about the classes, our location, and how to contact Mindful Habit. The site needs to be designed to be responsive so visitors can view it from a range of devices. As the contact information is not given its own page, it is important that this information is easily accessible from every page, placed just above the footer. An interactive Google Map is needed to give directions for anyone not familiar with the location.
