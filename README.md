### User Stories
#### Primary Goal

Mindful Habit is a site for women looking to learn how to practice mindfulness. The website needed to give users an insight into what Mindful Habit is about and a brief introduction of Mindful Habits 4 teaching techniques and their respective classes available.

#### Visitor Goals

Mindful Habits classes are for women of all ages, and it was a requirement that the website be a welcoming and calming space, that has a fresh and clutter free design. The Home page needs to showcase the classes available to users and encourage them to join. The gallery section of the site needs to show that all ages are welcome and give new site visitors a glimpse of what Mindful Habit classes look like. The site needs to be easy to navigate for all users seeking information about the classes, our location, and how to contact Mindful Habit. The site needs to be designed to be responsive so visitors can view it from a range of devices. As the contact information is not given its own page, it is important that this information is easily accessible from every page, placed just above the footer. An interactive Google Map is needed to give directions for anyone not familiar with the location.

#### New User

* A new user can access each page of the site from the navigation menu.
* A new user can read a brief introduction of the 4 practices Mindful Habit teaches in their classes.
* A new user can view the contact information, address, and Google Map pin drop easily. 
* A new user can view a gallery of previous classes to see who the classes are suitable for.
* A new user can book a free class via the Bookings page.
* A new user can follow Mindful Habit’s social media accounts from the footer.

#### Return Visitor
* All return visitors can check up on class times via the home page, and see any new classes added to the schedule.
* All return visitors can view the gallery page and see if they have featured in any of the class photos.
* All return visitors can find social media links in the footer to follow and support Mindful Habit on their social media accounts.

#### Site Admins

* I want to give users a brief introduction of what Mindful Habit does and who it is suitable for.
* I want to add group classes to the site and update them easily.
* I want to add a gallery of previous classes to showcase what our classes look like, and update them frequently.
* I want to add a booking form for users to book classes.
* I want to add contact information for users to be able to contact Mindful Habit easily.
* I want users to be able to navigate the site easily.
* I want to add a clear encouragement to users to join Mindful Habit’s classes.

### UX Design

Mindful Habit welcomes women of all ages to join classes, so a clutter free and clean look to the site is essential. Mindful Habit must be accessible on a wide range of devices due to the age range of class attendees.

#### Strategy

* The feel of the site needs to instil a sense of calm and peace for the user.
* Mindful Habit requires an easy to navigate website that delivers clear information about the classes on offer.
* The contact information and location need to be easily viewable from anywhere on the website, as this info will not have its own page.
* The booking process needs to be straight forward and easily found.
* Full responsiveness for all screen sizes is essential for this website.

#### Scope

* A short intro of what Mindful Habit is about is to be included on the home page.
* The site is to contain a brief explanation about the classes on offer, with a time and location for each class as well as an image that depicts each class.
* A gallery must showcase the previous class attendees and what new members can expect from our classes.
* Text must be clear and readable on all device sizes. 
* The navigation must be easily accessible to allow the user instant access to the home, gallery, and bookings pages.
* A clear call to action must be visible on the home page encouraging users to book a class.
* A booking form must collect a first and last name, email address and an option to choose 1 of the 4 classes to attend. The form must request the user to fill in each field, and give feedback that their form has been sent.

#### Structural

* The original navigation menu was to include links to the Classes and Contact sections of the home page, however, I chose to remove these as they do not have their own pages, and to make the menu more clear. 
* The classes information is to be displayed in separate tiles, in vertical rows on mobile devices, and horizontal rows on tablet and desktop devices, each separated by a border.
* A clear call to action button to bring the user to the booking form would be placed directly below the Classes section, and in colours similar to the site colours.
* The buttons on the site must provide feedback to the user, in the form of a colour change that followed the flow of the overall aesthetic.
* The navigation bar must scroll with the page on all devices, so that users can easily navigate to another page without having to scroll to the top to find the menu. This will be the same on all pages, across all devices.
* The contact information and footer would be visible on every page, at every device size. 

#### Skeleton

* For all pages, the logo Mindful Habit (including the lotus icon), is to be at the top-left for all screen sizes.
* The three navigation menu items 'Home', 'Gallery', and 'Bookings, are to be situated to the right-hand side of the nav bar on tablet and desktop screens, with an underline feature to show the user which page is currently active.  The navigation menu is to collapse in a hamburger icon situated on the right of the nav bar in mobile view. This will dropdown when clicked, displaying the website navigation menu.
* As a video is to be used for the hero section, a similar background image will be used used to display when networks speeds may be slower.
* The footer will appear on all pages, with links to Mindful Habit’s social media accounts.
